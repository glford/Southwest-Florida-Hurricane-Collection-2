## About the Collection

This collection focuses on gathering objects and materials related to hurricanes that have effected Southwest Florida and its communities. In 1960, Hurricane Donna was considered the worst of its kind to hit Florida, but since then mutiple other hurricanes have come and gone. By documenting these experiences, we can better understand the importance of hurricane readiness from the cost of destruction and the loss of life. 

## Hurricane Donna

"Hurricane Heads for Keys; Islanders Start Evacuating" read the headline on September 9, 1960 from the Fort Myers News-Press. They reported that Hurricane Donna was going to be the largest storm to hit the region since 1947, 13 years ago.
