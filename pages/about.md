## About the Collection

This collection focuses on gathering objects and materials related to hurricanes that have effected Southwest Florida and its communities. In 1960, Hurricane Donna was considered the worst of its kind to hit Florida, but since then mutiple other hurricanes have come and gone. By documenting these experiences, we can better understand the importance of hurricane readiness from the cost of destruction and the loss of life.
