## About the Collection

This collection focuses on gathering objects and materials related to hurricanes that have effected Southwest Florida and its communities. In 1960, Hurricane Donna was considered the worst of its kind to hit Florida, but since then mutiple other hurricanes have come and gone. By documenting these experiences, we can better understand the importance of hurricane readiness from the cost of destruction and the loss of life. 

## Hurricane Donna

"Hurricane Heads for Keys; Islanders Start Evacuating" read the headline on September 9, 1960 from the Fort Myers News-Press. They reported that Hurricane Donna was going to be the largest storm to hit the region since 1947, 13 years ago. Just a day ago, news from Havana, Cuba, detailed the storm's wrath, furious winds and pounding seas, as it destoryed coastal communities causing already 115 reported deaths. As Donna pushed toward Florida, Key West became deserted as hundreds fled toward the mainland. As the roadways became jammed packed, Miami's stores were being cleared of flashlights, batteries, candles, canned food, and camp stoves before they closed that night. 

In Fort Myers, schools closed early as hurricane preperations also got underway. Evacuations of Lee County's islands had already begun as hurricane watches loomed over Southwest Florida.
