## About the Collection

This collection focuses on gathering objects and materials related to hurricanes that have effected Southwest Florida and its communities. In 1960, Hurricane Donna was considered the worst of its kind to hit Florida, but since then mutiple other hurricanes have come and gone. By documenting these experiences, we can better understand the importance of hurricane readiness from the cost of destruction and the loss of life. 

## Hurricane Donna

"Hurricane Heads for Keys; Islanders Start Evacuating" read the headline on September 9, 1960 from the Fort Myers News-Press. They reported that Hurricane Donna was going to be the largest storm to hit the region since 1947, 13 years ago. Just a day ago, news from Havana, Cuba, detailed the storm's wrath, furious winds and pounding seas, as it destoryed coastal communities causing already 115 reported deaths. As Donna pushed toward Florida, Key West became deserted as hundreds fled toward the mainland. As the roadways became jammed packed, Miami's stores were being cleared of flashlights, batteries, candles, canned food, and camp stoves before they closed that night.

In Fort Myers, schools closed early as hurricane preperations also got underway. Evacuations of Lee County's islands had already begun as hurricane watches loomed over Southwest Florida. Hurricane warning flags flapped in the gusty winds with periodic rain. The clock turned to September 10th as the last preparations were made as the reckoning neared.

On September 11, the wrath of Hurricane Donna struck Southwest Florida. The next day, on the 12th, the Fort Myers News-Press released an article on the aftermath. Rufe Daughtrey described Bonita Beach as "a scene of devastation as though a war had been fought" in the twisted ruins of buildings, cracked trees, and tangled wires through the flooded streets. Another person's home was described as "gone except for one windowless wall left standing bleak as a bombed-out home on a battlefield." Two persons were reported missing and over 300 homes damaged. Schools were to be closed for two days as fish swam in Everglades streets.

Punta Gorda estimated that 1,220 homes had been damaged with 18 demolished. Roadways were blocked with downed trees and telephone wires. The school building also took hits which further suspended students until roadways were declared safe. In the Everglades, all residents of Collier County were advised to get typhoid shots as a possible epidemic loomed in the wake of Hurricane Donna as the sweage plant was unoperationable under a foot of mud.

Hurricane Donna claimed nine lives in Florida while damage estimates soared to nearly a billion dollars. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed Lee County and other affected areas as a major disaster area with the promise of federal aid. Already by the 13th, the Fort Myers News-Press reported that drinking water and power had been restored to many areas as Lee County Electric Cooperative and Inter-County Telephone Co. worked relentlessly. The Civil Defense organization brought in 60,000 pounds of dry ice into Fort Myers alone to help refrigerate items.

Ernie Stevens, a poet of Fort Myers wrote, "There was a young lady named Donna. To meet her I'm sure you don't wanna. She came from Key West Full of vigor and zest And ruined our flora and fuana." Hurricane Donna damaged Florida agriculture and nature reserves. The citrus producing counties of Polk, Orange, and Lake were estimated to sustained $250 million in damages to their citrus crop. Citrus trees had been uprooted and broken in Labelle and Fort Denaud. Everglades National Park was also tore up as the hurricane blew across the state.

While Florida got to work on repairing damages, Hurricane Donna continued her path northward, sweeping across the Carolinas before slamming finally into New England. As the hurricane died out, it killed 20 dead in the U.S. and cost damages along the entire East Coast. Hurricane Donna highlighted that well-in-advance alerts kept loss of life to a low level.
